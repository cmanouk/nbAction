## Customer Quote ##
My friends and I have had a fantasy league for more than a decade. During the pandemic,
we haven't been able to see much of each other but we try to stay in close contact. nbAction
provides the perfect outlet for us to stay tuned into our favorite team and check in on
fantasy players across the league. We send messages and articles to each other all the time
and it has added a whole new dynamic to the fan experience!
